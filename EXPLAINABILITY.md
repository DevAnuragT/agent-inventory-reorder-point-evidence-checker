# Decision and Reasoning

Check reorder point decisions against lead time, demand evidence, and safety stock policy. The implementation evaluates each field rule independently. Overall status follows the number of passed checks; failures include observed evidence and a correction action.

# Inputs and Data Sources

Input is caller-provided JSON. Rule definitions live in metadata.json. No web, credentials, or external service are consulted.

# Known Limitations

Checks validate submitted representation only. They cannot confirm real-world truth, legal sufficiency, or safety. Human review remains required.
